Open community grants to help new and existing members to grow and build in the crypto ecosystem.

## Overview
Whilst diving back into the crypto rabbit hole, I wanted to see what Crypto grants/programs are open for individuals/collectives to build on.

They are great community initiatives to help new and existing engineers and product creators to build the crypto ecosystem. 

Have most likely missed quite a few. 

Please understand that a lot of projects have contributed awesome efforts outside of grant programs through hackathons, events and Gitcoin contributions. 

Feel free to submit PR's for new ecosystem links + fixes.
